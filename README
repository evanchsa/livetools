livetools - Creative Live!Drive IR Daemon, interface library and XMMS plugin

* Introduction

The Live!Drive IR that ships with SoundBlaster Live! 5.1 Platinum has a small 
infrared port on it that allows the user to use his/her computer like a home 
entertainment system. The IR port is actually a MIDI device that sends MIDI 
System Exclusive commands whenever a key is pressed.

* Plugins

XMMS

This is a simple plugin that interfaces with liveird. You need both the liveird 
and liveir_sdk packages installed. You should have received them with the 
livetools distribution. This is a General plugin; look in that tab in XMMS' 
preferences and enable it. You should also configure the device that liveird 
reads from.

* Remotes Supported:

Creative RM-900
- Bundled with the Live!Drive IR and SoundBlaster Live! Platinum 5.1 kit.
- The Audigy uses this remote too, so when Linux has support for the IR port on
  that I imagine it will work without any changes.

Creative iR2000
- Bundled with the 52x iNFRA CD-Drive

* Installation

See INSTALL for general configure help. In order to use this daemon you need to 
have libliveir installed. You should have received a copy of it if you 
downloaded the livetools distribution. To install:

	./configure
	make
	make install (generally as root)

The distribution is installed in /usr/local by default. The XMMS plugin 
can be found in the General Plugins section.  

* Configuration

Changes must be made to /etc/modules.conf .

In order for the daemon to recieve the key codes from the remote you must 
enable the IR port:

	# ALSA Specific Example
	alias snd-card-0 snd-card-emu10k1
	options snd-card-emu10k1 snd_enable_ir=1

ALSA Drivers

If you use ALSA, use the /dev/midi device. I think this device is 
acutally part of the OSS emulation layer, the native ALSA device 
will also work I think.

OSS Drivers

The devices /dev/midi0? must be used where ? is a valid device number. 
Usually it's MIDI device 0.
